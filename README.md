## About

In tribute to one of my favourite scenes in Red Dwarf and wanting to use Rust, this is a simple Rust application that writes "I am a fish".

>Lister: Whatch'ya doin'? \
Rimmer: I'm studying for my engineering exam. \
Lister: By writing on your body? Wouldn't that be cheating? \
Rimmer: It's not cheating, it's simply an aid to memory. \
Lister: I know! Why don't you hand your body in and let them mark that? \
Rimmer: You wouldn't understand, Lister, what it's like... (insert Rimmer-rant here, where he complains about how nothing's fair) \
Lister: What's the point, though? You're just gonna go in there and flunk again. \
Rimmer: For your information Lister, I only failed last time by the narrowest of narrow margins. \
Lister: Narrowest of narrow margins?! You walked in, wrote "I am a fish" 400 times, did a funny little dance and fainted! \
Rimmer: I did not. \
Lister: Yes you did. Petersen told me. \
Rimmer: (mimics Lister) Petersen told me. (normally) If you must know, I wrote a discourse on porous circuits that was simlpy too radical, too unconventional, too mold-breaking for the examiners to accept. \
Lister: Yeah, you said you were a fish.
